The Software Development Group at NISER has been operational since the fall of 2018. The group aims to bring together people from different
disciplines who prefer a code first approach to solving problems.

We encourage people who have any novel idea that could help the
institution and might be implemented in code, to contact the SDG. On our own,
we had initiated certain projects, like the [NISER
Archive](https://github.com/sdgniser/arc) and a [timetable
generator](https://github.com/sdgniser/timetable), which are nearly complete
now.

NISER SDG can be contacted via email at
[sdg@niser.ac.in](mailto:sdgniser.ac.in). You may [follow us on
GitHub](https://github.com/sdgniser), or
[subscribe to our blog via RSS](/feed.xml).
