The Software Development Group at NISER has been operational since the fall of
2018, with the aim of bringing together people from different
disciplines who prefer a code first approach to solving problems.

Over the past few months, we have been working on certain projects, like the
[NISER Archive](https://github.com/sdgniser/arc) and a [timetable
generator](https://github.com/sdgniser/timetable), which are nearly complete
now.

We encourage people who have any novel idea that could help the
institution and might be implemented in code, to contact us.
We can be reached via email at [sdg [at] niser [dot] ac [dot] in]().
You may also [follow us on GitHub](https://github.com/sdgniser), and
[subscribe to our blog via RSS](/feed.xml).
